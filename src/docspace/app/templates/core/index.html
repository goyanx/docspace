                What happens when I upload a complaint to docspace?

            <p>
                Several models from <a href="https://cohere.ai/">Cohere</a> are used to extract and summarize information relevant to the specific 
                claims, counts, and causes of action related to your case.  Your case is then compared to our database of complaints
                and our claim type ontology to show you the key claims in your case and the most similar complaints in our database.

                I want to try it out.  Where can I find complaints for free?
            </p>
            <p>
                Click random example to see documents that have already been processed by our pipeline.  If you would like to upload a complaint
                you can find free documents on <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&type=r&order_by=score%20desc&available_only=on&description=complaint&filed_after=01%2F01%2F2019">RECAP</a>.
                Any document filed before 2017 or after February 2017 will be outside of the distribution of our existing dataset.

                Why is this useful?
            </p>
            <p>
                Most legal analytics products like <a href="https://lexmachina.com/">Lex Machina</a> or <a href="https://www.docketalarm.com/">Docket Alarm</a> only look at the docket sheet.  This means that the specific claims and causes of action
                in a case, and the related judge behaviors, cannot be analyzed.  Docspace takes the first step in making this finer-grained information accessible.
